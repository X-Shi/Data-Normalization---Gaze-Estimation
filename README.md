# Data Normalization - Gaze Estimation
This repository contains code for normalizing ETH-XGaze, MPIIFaceGaze, and Gaze360 in multi-region 224x224 and 448x448.
The separate code for different datasets can be found in those folders. 
This is a repository for the code used to generate input data for the paper *Investigation of Architectures and Receptive Fields for Appearance-based Gaze Estimation*. The main code repository can be found at [https://github.com/yunhanwang1105/GazeTech](https://github.com/yunhanwang1105/GazeTech)
